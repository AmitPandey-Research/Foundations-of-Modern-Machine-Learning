# Foundations-of-Modern-Machine-Learning

This is my way of giving back to the open source learning community. 
I will be posting content to help people learn fundamentals of machine learning from the very basics.
The concepts are divided into modules.
Most of the codes here can be directly implemented in Google Colab. (Huge Thanks to Google for providing such a wonderful tool).
Always open to discussion. Feel free to reach out to me in case you have any doubts.
